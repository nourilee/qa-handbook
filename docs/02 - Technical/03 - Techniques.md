# Testing Techniques and Strategies

In technical interviews for software testing roles, candidates are often asked about various testing techniques and strategies used to ensure the quality and reliability of software products. This section explores different testing approaches that are commonly assessed during these interviews.

## Test Case Design Techniques

Effective test case design is essential for thorough testing. Familiarize yourself with these techniques ✍️ 

### Equivalence Partitioning

- Dividing input values into equivalent classes.
- Testing representative values from each class.
- Efficient way to cover multiple scenarios with fewer test cases.

> [Example] ✍️ _Testing a login form where you partition usernames into valid and invalid classes to cover different scenarios._

### Boundary Value Analysis

- Testing values at the lower and upper boundaries of input ranges.
- Identifying defects that occur at boundaries.
- Enhancing test coverage around critical points.

> [Example] ✍️ _Testing a shopping cart where you check for the behavior when the item quantity is at its minimum (0) and maximum (99)._

## Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is a hands-on approach that involves simultaneously designing and executing test cases. Key points include ✍️ 

- Discovering defects that scripted testing might miss.
- Adapting to changing requirements and scenarios.
- Using critical thinking to uncover hidden issues.

> [Example] ✍️ _Exploring a new feature in an application without a scripted test plan, focusing on real-world usage scenarios._
> [Example] ✍️ _Identifying user experience issues during exploratory testing of a mobile app, such as unexpected crashes or navigation problems._

## Regression Testing

Regression testing ensures that new code changes don't negatively impact existing functionality. Concepts to understand include ✍️ 

- Re-running test cases on modified code.
- Detecting unintended side effects.
- Automating regression tests for efficiency.

> [Example] ✍️ _After adding a new payment method, regression testing ensures that existing payment methods still work as expected._
> [Example] ✍️ _When fixing a bug, regression testing verifies that the bug fix doesn't introduce new issues._

## Performance Testing

Performance testing evaluates software responsiveness and stability under varying loads. Key points include ✍️ 

- Identifying performance bottlenecks.
- Load Testing - Assessing system behavior under expected load.
- Stress Testing - Testing system's limits under extreme load.

> [Load Testing Example] ✍️ _Simulating concurrent user logins to ensure the application can handle the expected number of users during peak times._  
> [Stress Testing Example] ✍️ _Sending a large number of simultaneous requests to a web server to test its behavior under heavy load._

## Security Testing

Security testing identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection. Concepts to grasp include ✍️ 

- Vulnerability Assessment - Identifying potential weaknesses.
- Penetration Testing - Simulating attacks to expose vulnerabilities.
- Compliance Testing - Ensuring software adheres to security standards.

> [Vulnerability Assessment Example] ✍️ _Using a scanning tool to identify potential security weaknesses in a web application's code._  
> [Penetration Testing Example] ✍️ _Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, to gain unauthorized access to a system._  
> [Compliance Testing Example] ✍️ _Verifying that an e-commerce platform's payment processing system adheres to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to ensure the secure handling of credit card information during transactions._

## Usability Testing

Usability testing assesses the user-friendliness of software. Understand these aspects ✍️ 

- User-Centered Design - Prioritizing user needs.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - Validating software from the user's perspective.
- Identifying and rectifying usability issues.

> [Example] ✍️ _Testing the ease of navigation in an e-commerce website by asking users to perform specific tasks, such as finding a product or completing a purchase._  
> [Example] ✍️ _Collecting user feedback on a mobile app's interface and interaction design to enhance its usability._
