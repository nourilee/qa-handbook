# Performance and Security Testing

In technical interviews for software testing roles, candidates are often questioned about their understanding of performance and security testing concepts, methodologies, and best practices. This section covers the key aspects of performance and security testing that are commonly assessed during these interviews.

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

- Simulating expected user loads to assess system behavior.
- Identifying performance bottlenecks under normal and peak loads.

### Stress Testing

- Pushing the system beyond its limits to assess its stability.
- Identifying how the system handles extreme conditions.

### Scalability Testing

- Assessing the system's ability to handle increasing loads.
- Ensuring that the system can be scaled horizontally or vertically.

## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Assessment

- Identifying potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- Using tools and techniques to uncover security flaws.

### Penetration Testing

- Simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- Ethical hacking to assess system security.

### Compliance Testing

- Ensuring the software adheres to security standards and regulations.
- Validating compliance with industry-specific security requirements.

### Performance Testing

1. **What is the purpose of scalability testing in performance testing?**
   - A) To assess the system's stability under extreme conditions.
   - B) To identify potential security vulnerabilities.
   - C) To ensure the software adheres to security standards.
   - D) To assess the system's ability to handle increasing loads.

2. **Which type of performance testing involves pushing the system beyond its limits to assess stability?**
   - A) Load Testing
   - B) Stress Testing
   - C) Scalability Testing

### Security Testing

1. **What is the primary goal of vulnerability assessment in security testing?**
   - A) To simulate real-world attacks.
   - B) To ensure compliance with industry standards.
   - C) To identify potential security vulnerabilities.
   - D) To assess the system's scalability.

2. **What does OWASP stand for in the context of software security?**
   - A) Open Web Application Security Protocol
   - B) Organized Web Application Security Practices
   - C) Operating Web Application Security Project
   - D) Open Web Application Security Project
