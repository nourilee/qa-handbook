# Test Planning and Documentation

In technical interviews for software testing roles, candidates are often evaluated on their ability to create effective test plans, test strategies, and comprehensive documentation. This section explores the key aspects of test planning and documentation commonly assessed during these interviews.

## Test Planning

### Understanding Requirements

- Thoroughly analyzing software requirements to identify testable features.
- Ensuring that requirements are clear, complete, and unambiguous.

### Defining Test Objectives and Scope

- Setting clear goals for what needs to be tested.
- Defining the scope of testing, including in-scope and out-of-scope items.

### Test Strategy and Approach

- Outlining the overall testing approach, such as manual vs. automated testing.
- Defining the testing levels (unit, integration, system, etc.) to be performed.

## Test Documentation

### Test Cases and Scenarios

- Writing detailed test cases that cover different scenarios.
- Including preconditions, steps, expected results, and postconditions.

### Traceability Matrix

- Creating a matrix to track the mapping between requirements and test cases.
- Ensuring all requirements are covered by corresponding test cases.

### Test Data and Environment

- Documenting the test data required for each test case.
- Specifying the test environment setup needed for testing.

### Test Execution and Results

- Recording test execution results, including passed and failed tests.
- Capturing defects with detailed information for developers.
