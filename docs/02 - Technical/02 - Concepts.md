# Conceptual Knowledge Assessment

## Fundamentals of Software Testing

Software testing is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle that ensures the quality and reliability of software products. Some key points to understand include:

- **Purpose of Testing:** To identify defects, ensure functionality, and validate software against requirements.
- **Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control:** QA focuses on processes to prevent defects, while QC involves identifying and fixing defects.
- **Verification and Validation:** Verification ensures that the product is built according to specifications, while validation ensures it meets user requirements.

## Testing Methodologies and Approaches

Different testing methodologies and approaches guide the testing process. Familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

- **Waterfall Model:** A linear approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- **Agile Methodology:** An iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration and flexibility.
- **DevOps:** Integrates development and operations, focusing on continuous integration and delivery.

## SDLC and Testing Phases

Understanding the software development life cycle (SDLC) and its testing phases is crucial:

- **Requirements Phase:** Analyzing requirements to create test cases.
- **Design Phase:** Creating test plans and test scripts.
- **Development Phase:** Performing unit tests.
- **Testing Phase:** Conducting integration, system, and acceptance tests.
- **Deployment Phase:** Ensuring the software works as intended in the live environment.

## Importance of Early Testing

Early testing is vital to identify and rectify defects sooner in the development process:

- **Bug Prevention:** Detecting defects early reduces the cost of fixing them.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Early testing provides feedback to developers, aiding in quality improvement.
- **Stakeholder Confidence:** Effective testing from the beginning builds confidence in the final product.
